  - `yarn setup:backend`: Set up backend environment including dependency installation, database setup, and code generation.

#### Development and Deployment Steps:

**Option 1: Setup Project Backend for Local Development**

- `yarn setup:backend` Install dependencies and generate type for GraphQL and Prisma
- `docker compose up db-primary cache -d` Run database container
- `yarn setup:database` Migrate and seed data to database
- `yarn backend:dev` Start server backend
- After backend server started  
    - New terminal -> `yarn backend:test` run test backend service

**Setup project blogs(frontend) for dev on local**

- `yarn` Install dependencies
- `yarn codegen-client` Generate for Apollo client
- `yarn blogs:dev` Start server blogs
- After blogs server started  â€”> http://localhost:4200

**Option 2: Using Projects with Docker Compose**

- `yarn setup:backend`
- `yarn codegen-client`
- `yarn build`
- `docker compose up -d`
- `yarn setup:database`
- `yarn backend:test`
- Go to http://localhost:4200

**Option 3: Setup 2 Projects for Dev on Local**

- `docker compose up db-primary cache -d`
- `yarn setup:backend`
- `yarn codegen-client`
- `yarn setup:database`
- `yarn dev` Start server many project blogs and backend
- Go to http://localhost:4200
